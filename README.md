# serverless-data-lake-with-S3-and-Glue
This project demonstrates how to build a serverless data lake using Amazon S3 and AWS Glue. The project includes code for creating an S3 bucket, an AWS Glue crawler, and an AWS Glue job. The crawler will periodically scan the S3 bucket for new data files, and the job will run a data quality script to check the quality of the data.
